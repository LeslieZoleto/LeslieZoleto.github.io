            <p>The tortilla is a cornerstone of Mexican cuisine and culture, particularly in the legacy of the Mexica
                (Aztec) civilization. For the Mexica, corn wasn’t just a staple—it was a symbol of life and sustenance.
                Maize was central to their diet, and tortillas, made fresh daily, were the most common way to consume
                it.
                They paired tortillas with a variety of foods, from beans and squash to chili peppers, creating
                nutritious
                meals that sustained the population. Tortillas were also used as wraps for food, which laid the
                groundwork
                for popular dishes like tacos.
            </p>

            <p>
                The process of making tortillas—especially nixtamalization, which involves soaking maize in a lime
                solution—made the grain more nutritious by increasing its calcium and amino acid content. This process
                turned corn into masa, the dough used for tortillas, and became fundamental to Mexican gastronomy. In
                Mexica
                culture, food wasn’t just nourishment but a reflection of their connection to the land, and tortillas
                symbolized the bond between people, maize, and the gods. Today, tortillas continue to represent this
                legacy,
                remaining an essential component of Mexican cuisine in dishes like tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas, and
                sopes. The simple tortilla has grown beyond its roots to become a globally beloved food, but in Mexican
                cuisine, it remains irreplaceable, embodying centuries of tradition, community, and resilience.
